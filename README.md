### My first advanced Android application started developing at 16.07.2018 and stopped developing at 16.08.2018, unfortunately it wasn't finished.

## Getting Started

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Internship at Mobillium started at 02.07.2018 and after 2 weeks of learning how android works i started my own project. Our mentor said that we should use an API, understand how they work through android. I started searching for free APIs, found several of them but as i am Formula 1 fan i have chosen the [Ergast Developer API](https://ergast.com/mrd/).
